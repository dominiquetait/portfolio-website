				<h4>DEMOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION</h4>
				<p>I'm a 21-year-old female from South Africa, currently studying full-time at Swinburne University.</p>

				<h4>HOMETOWN</h4>
				<p>
					I was born in Durban, South Africa, and grew up between Durban and Johannesburg before moving to Australia 
					in 2012. After living in Brisbane and Perth, I settled in Melbourne in 2018, where I currently reside. My 
					hometown, Durban, is a vibrant coastal city known for its golden beaches along the Indian Ocean, year-round 
					subtropical climate, and being home to the busiest port in Africa. It's also famous for its rich cultural 
					mix, Indian cuisine - especially the iconic 'bunny chow' - and being a hub for surfing and outdoor activities.

				<h4>GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT</h4>
				<p>
					One of my greatest achievements so far has been completing my first year of university while also designing 
					and developing my first small game project. Balancing full-time study with a creative pursuit not only 
					strengthened my time management skills but also gave me the confidence to pursue a career in games development.

				<h4>INTERESTS</h4>
				<div class="interests-container">
					<p>
						Some of my favourite games include Fallout, Minecraft, Helldivers 2, Destiny 2, and Marvel Rivals. I don't read
						much for leisure, but I do enjoy diving into books when they're about topics I want to learn more about, such
						as programming or design. When it comes to films, I like action movies such as Baby Driver and the Marvel 
						Cinematic Universe, though I tend to enjoy TV series even more. I'm especially drawn to mystery, crime, and 
						drama shows like Suits, Found, The Rookie, House M.D., and Psych, as well as comedies like Brooklyn 99 and 
						Friends.

					I also enjoy spending time with friends, and the image above shows me with a few of them at a nice restaurant 
					in Melbourne. I chose this photo because it was taken on my 21st birthday, when we all went out to celebrate together.
